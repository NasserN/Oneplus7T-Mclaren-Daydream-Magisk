# Oneplus7T-Mclaren-Daydream-Magisk
Enables Daydream on the Oneplus7T Mclaren
Install at your own risk, I've only tested it on my own phone and take no responsibility for any issues you have as a result.

# Installation/Usage
To install, just move this zip file to your phones internal storage and flash it in magisk. Download Daydream and Daydream Keyboard from APKMirror and run daydream as usual. The daydream app will be a little distorted but other VR apps will be normal.

# Warning!
This will cause safety-net checks to fail, this is due to the module telling reporting itself as a Pixel 3XL. To get around this, disable the module and restart your handset when you need to get around safety-net.
